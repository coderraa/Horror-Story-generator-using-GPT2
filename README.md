# Horror-Story-generator-using-GPT2
**@Author: *Rahul Singh***

“GPT-2 achieves state-of-the-art scores on a variety of domain-specific language modeling tasks. Our model is not trained on any of the data specific to any of these tasks and is only evaluated on them as a final test; this is known as the “zero-shot” setting. GPT-2 outperforms models trained on Horror Story data sets (e.g. Wikipedia, news, books) when evaluated on those same data sets.”
